We should include the used datasets in this folder, you can download both of them from the following links:

MovieLens 100K Dataset (ml-100k): https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/
MovieLens 1M Dataset (ml-1m): https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/

The resulting folder structure should be:

data/
	ml-1m/
		movies.dat
		ratings.dat
		README
		users.dat
	ml-100k/
		allbut.pl
		mku.sh
		README
		u.data
		... (18 more files)
		ub.test
	online-data/
		...
	datasources.txt

'online-data' folder will be auto-generated once the dataset extension script is executed and it will contain all the information downloaded through the MovieDB API.
